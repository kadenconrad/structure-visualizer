# ABOUT DATA STRUCTURES
### ARRAYS
A data structure consisting of elements of the same memory size, identified by at least one index or index tuple. Each element can be computed by its index.

*Two Dimensional Arrays are sometimes called "matrices."*
**Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures.**
#### Operations
- Traversal
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Search
- Display

### LINKED LISTS
Linear collection of data linked by pointers; instead of a contiguous set of data, linked list nodes contain data values and a pointer to the next node.

*Linked lists can be used to implement various other data structures list stacks, queues, graphs, hash maps, etc*

- The *head* node: points to the first node in a linked list;
- The *tail* node: last node in a linked list; points to null

**Singly Linked Lists**
Point to only the next node; traversals are done in only one direction

**Doubly Linked List**
Point to both the previous and next node, 3 values in each node; traversals are done in only one direction

#### Operations
- Insertion: Adds element at *beginning* of list
- Deletion: Deletes element at *beginning* of list
- Display: Displays complete list
- Search: Searches for element using given key
- Delete: Deletes an element using given key
